# Opcode Table Specification

## Complete Table for Minimal Assembler

The opcode table starts at $0400 with 6-byte entries. Here's the complete specification:

## Data Layout in Memory

Each entry is 6 bytes: 4 bytes mnemonic + 1 byte opcode + 1 byte type:
```
Entry 0: 4C 44 41 23    ; "LDA#"
         A9 01          ; $A9, type 1
Entry 1: 4C 44 41 20    ; "LDA "
         AD 02          ; $AD, type 2
Entry 2: 4C 44 41 5A    ; "LDAZ"
         A5 01          ; $A5, type 1
... etc
```

## Type Codes
- **Type 0**: No operand (implied instructions)
  - Output: [opcode] EA EA EA

- **Type 1**: Single byte operand
  - Output: [opcode] [operand] EA EA

- **Type 2**: Two byte operand (little-endian)
  - Output: [opcode] [low-byte] [high-byte] EA

- **Type 3**: Branch offset (multiply by 4 for 4-byte instruction spacing)
  - Input: signed instruction count (-128 to +127)
  - Output: [opcode] [offset*4] EA EA

## Special Cases

### END Marker
The "END " opcode ($FF) is not a real 6502 instruction - it's used by the assembler to detect end of source code.

### Branch Calculation Examples
- `BNE  01` = branch forward 1 instruction = offset +4 = $04
- `BEQ  03` = branch forward 3 instructions = offset +12 = $0C
- `BNE  FF` = branch back 1 instruction = offset -4 = $FC
- `BEQ  FD` = branch back 3 instructions = offset -12 = $F4

### Table End Detection
The assembler stops searching when it finds an entry starting with $00 or reaches the table end.

## Total Size
- 52 entries Ã— 6 bytes = 312 bytes
- Fits in opcode table area with room for expansion
