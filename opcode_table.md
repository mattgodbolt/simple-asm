```

## Data Layout in Memory

Starting at $0400:
```
$0400: 4C 44 41 23    ; "LDA#" 
$0404: A9 01          ; $A9, type 1
$0406: 4C 44 41 20    ; "LDA " 
$040A: AD 02          ; $AD, type 2
$040C: 4C 44 41 5A    ; "LDAZ"
$0410: A5 01          ; $A5, type 1
... etc
```

## Type Codes
- **Type 0**: No operand (implied instructions)
  - Output: [opcode] EA EA EA
  
- **Type 1**: Single byte operand
  - Output: [opcode] [operand] EA EA
  
- **Type 2**: Two byte operand (little-endian)
  - Output: [opcode] [low-byte] [high-byte] EA
  
- **Type 3**: Branch offset (multiply by 4 for 4-byte instruction spacing)
  - Input: signed instruction count (-128 to +127)
  - Output: [opcode] [offset*4] EA EA

## Special Cases

### END Marker
The "END " opcode ($FF) is not a real 6502 instruction - it's used by the assembler to detect end of source code.

### Branch Calculation Examples
- `BNE  01` = branch forward 1 instruction = offset +4 = $04
- `BEQ  03` = branch forward 3 instructions = offset +12 = $0C  
- `BNE  FF` = branch back 1 instruction = offset -4 = $FC
- `BEQ  FD` = branch back 3 instructions = offset -12 = $F4

### Table End Detection
The assembler stops searching when it reaches $0538 (beyond the last entry) or finds an entry starting with $00.

## Total Size
- 42 entries Ã— 6 bytes = 252 bytes
- Fits comfortably in 256-byte page at $0400-$04FF
- Leaves room for expansion up to $0500
